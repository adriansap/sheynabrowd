        <p>I am Sophia,
            For those who do t know he- I’m a wife, a mother of six grown children and many grandchildren.
            I was born into as large family in Russia, where my parents kept fighting to keep our Jewish faith alive in
            Communist Era.
            Eventually , we were able to escape to Israel
            Where I got married abd moved to the USA.

            In my early years I was a teacher and educator at different Jewish schools .
            Throughout my teaching career , I noticed how we out so much emphasis on our Faith and studies, and often
            neglect to take care of our health and nutrition .
            I also noticed health issues arising from weight gain and health disorders , I decided to start researching
            and hearing different natural ways, that I can make an impact on my community.

            I took him home ... against medical advice ..and started feeding him the micronutrients

            Abd only after three days he went from non -responsive to moving his head abd arm- I a light at the end of
            the tunnel !
            Long story short- he was eating solid food within three weeks!

            My Goals,
            My goal is simple and bold !
            Together with my team - imI want to help change tge nutritional habits and impact my community to live
            healthy , active lifestyle

            It’s my passion and commitment, to help everyone I can to get healthier and I go beyond the expectations to
            get the job done
        </p>
